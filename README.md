# hackathon-barcode-scanner-backend

backend (web service and rest api) for the QRU app used to keep track of hackers at hackru spring 2017

This is deprecated in favor of LCS. See [the docs therein](https://github.com/HackRU/lcs/wiki/LCS-API-endpoints#qr)
for how to use that and where it fits in.

The original is a little more updated to handle multiple backends, so be sure to check that out.
